# My First Portfolio

This repository contains my first HTML project where I am learning the basics of web development. It includes:
- A basic HTML file (`base_index.html`) with a valid structure.
- The implementation of HTML best practices.
- A focus on W3C validation.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I will be able to explain:
- What HTML is.
- How to create an HTML page.
- What a markup language is.
- What the DOM is.
- What elements, tags, and attributes are.
- How the browser loads a webpage.
